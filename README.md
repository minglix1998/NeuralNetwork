# Simple Neural Network for Handwritten Digit Recognition

This repository contains a straightforward implementation of a neural network using numpy to recognize handwritten digits based on the MNIST dataset.

## Features

- Three-layer neural network (Input, Hidden, Output).
- Sigmoid activation function.
- Implements stochastic gradient descent for training.
- Uses the MNIST dataset for training and testing.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- numpy

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   \```
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   \```

2. Make sure you have `numpy` installed:
   \```
   pip install numpy
   \```

3. Run the neural network:
   \```
   python neural_network.py
   \```

After running, the neural network will train on the MNIST dataset and output its accuracy on the test data after each epoch.
